जब तलक तीर तिरा आवे है नख़चीर तलक
ले ये नख़चीर ही आ पहुँचा तिरे तीर तलक
	*Before your arrow could ever reach its prey, / by the time your arrow could ever reach it's prey
	The prey himself/itself had come, right to the tip of your arrow

	There is a well-known saying in Urdu/Hindi—_“apne hi pair par kulhāṛī mārnā”_—which loosely means _to strike an axe upon one’s own foot_. A lesser-used but sharper variant reverses the motion: _“kulhāṛī par pair mārnā”_—to **step onto the axe itself**.
	Mir’s couplet closely resembles this second formulation, but amplifies its violence and inevitability a hundredfold. Here, harm is not accidental or foolish; it is **deliberate, accelerated, and almost eager**. 
	

---
	The couplet is a striking example of the **vehshat** that is a trademark trait of the Classical Urdu Ghazal. What it stages is a double urgency:  
	the predator is impatient to strike, and the prey is equally impatient to be struck. Desire(predator's) and destruction(prey's) race toward each other, as the distance between intention and consequence collapses. The most striking image is the eagerness of the prey.

	**Understanding the metaphor**
	It's in the predator's nature to kill the prey, but what kind of prey is this who rather than running away from the danger(the beloved), is running towards it. The lover is in love with someone who he knows is going to be the end of them and yet he doesn't hesitate to lay his life down in the process. 
	For the predator killing the prey is merely a hobby, a fun activity if you may, but for the prey it is existential and knowing this he still surrenders his life just for her fun. 

दस्त-ओ-पा मारे बहुत चाह-ए-ज़नख़ में दिल ने
हाथ लेकिन न गया ज़ुल्फ़ की ज़ंजीर तलक
	*The heart struggled desperately in the longing of your dimples,*
	 *But the hands couldn't even reach the (chain-like) tresses* 
	 

---
	The couplet creates a very striking and tragic image, he put all his efforts in trying to reach her but he couldn't even get a hold of her tresses, even though he knew the tresses were akin to chains, once reached he will never be free, yet he strives., nonetheless. 
	PS- the beloved is often said to have absurdly long tresses so long that she might even get her feet entangled

	It's akin to a bird trying to get into a cage because it's made of gold, and then lamenting when he wasn't able to do so, knowing full well that if he had gotten in, he wouldn't have been able to come out of it. 
	The tragedy of it all is he did all he could and still didn't succeed but even if he had succeeded he would have been chained in her tresses, but now that he has failed in doing so, he is chained by the hopes/dreams of doing so. To conclude there's no freedom for him, he won't know what to do in either situation. As Ghalib says- 
		*हमारे ज़ेहन में उस फ़िक्र का है नाम विसाल*
		*कि गर न हो तो कहाँ जाएँ हो तो क्यूँकर हो*
